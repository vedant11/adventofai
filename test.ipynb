      "\"The sky typically appears blue during the day under clear conditions due to Rayleigh scattering, which scatters shorter wavelength blue and violet light from the sun more than the longer wavelength red. However, the actual color of the sky can vary depending on weather conditions, time of day, and altitude. At sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink. During sunset and sunrise, the presence of more atmospheric particles scatters the sunlight in a way that makes these colors more prominent. At night, the sky is perceived as black because the sun's light is blocked, and it's dark outside.\"\n"
