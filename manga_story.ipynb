      "A tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem (or trunk), supporting branches and leaves in most species. Trees are vital for ecosystems, providing oxygen, improving air quality, conserving water, and supporting wildlife. Trees serve as the backbone of many ecosystems, playing a multifaceted role that extends beyond their physical structure. Their roots stabilize the soil, preventing erosion, while their leaves contribute to the oxygen supply and water purification. Through photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide, mitigating climate change by holding heavy carbon. They form habitats for countless species, creating a complex web of biodiversity. Furthermore, trees contribute to the sustenance and economy of human societies; they are a source of building materials, fuel, and food. In urban environments, trees enhance quality of life, reducing noise pollution, and\n"
